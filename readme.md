This took a lot of time! I guess the hardest part was trying to figure out how to extend the graph by one node and how to do a breadth-first traversal. A lof of debugging was involved.

Phase 1 wasn't so hard since it is a pretty direct application of the lectures and the tree is pretty similar to LinkedList. The hardest part of phase 2 was just figuring out how to traverse a decision tree. Phase 3 was the hardest, but all is well! 

Is this how the Akinator is implemented? It seems like so but then I feel like the tree would be so huge though. How could you make it more managable in dealing with so much info.
