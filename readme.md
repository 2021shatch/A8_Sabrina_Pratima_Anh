## Reflection

This assignment wasn't that bad. However, I did struggle more than I thought I would trying to read the different notations to understand how the tree prints out. I really wish there was a visualization software or file we could implement. 

We really only worked on it together a couple of times. Doing things in a bigger group has been extremely helpful since Anh and I often have the same thought processes. The first time, we worked on the "house-keeping" stuff (i.e. constructors, getters and setters, etc). This really wasn't too bad. 

Then, we kind of went our separate ways and divided up most of the work (don't worry, we ended up doing most of it together over slack because we work much better all together). It wasn't insanely difficult, just a lot of drawing out scenarios and googling syntax. 

The next time we met in person was at office hours on Monday. All we really had to do was deal with taking the input from the user and then writing it to the txt file. Everything seemed to be going according to plan except that only half the binary tree was printing out and that sometimes it just wouldn't print at all and throw an exception. 

We were very puzzled by the latter at first because it had just been working moments before, but thankfully the TA caught that we had copy and pasted into the txt file and had an extra space at the end! Oh my gosh I thought I was going to go insane.

Then, our last issue was just an indexing problem. The difference between a -2 and a -1. Welp those are 2 hours of my life I'll never get back. 

Anyways, the assignment wasn't too bad. I'm definitely looking forward to having more creative freedom in the final project as we close out the end of the semester. 

P.S.

I'm really sorry the checklists have been empty. Anh and I are very confused because we always go through it at the end of TA hours. I am not sure if it's a Moodle or Replit error, but often when I zip the file, I notice the checklist or sometimes the readme edits are not saved? I'm not sure why. Anyways, I'll double check for this one.
